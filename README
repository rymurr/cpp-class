5) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py. lots of documentation of GUI and backend...Doxygen AND Sphinx.

7) Imortant to note that currently program assumes that tinitial is given at the peak of a real ionizatione event and initial conditions are sampled there only.

9) OpenMP integrator and binner, separately. Integrate and bin in one step using OpenMP. map/reduce to integrate and bin in 1 shot on large cluster.

9) need to design a/several parallelization types (map/reduce, MPI, OpenMP) for creation, running and binning of ICs

10) lots of gui connections to make to interface properly with code

11) design plotting schemes and write the interface

12) important to be able to transfer half done simulation from server to client and vice-versa

13) write SCP module for transfers - send, recieve, schedule, notify.

15) user docs in sphinx

16) distribute on more platforms! need a nicer icon...

18) finish doxygen docs and add an intro section to Doxygen site, link to sphinx site

21) add phi, polarization, to Python GUI. integrator strategy,  add descriptions to gui for mouse-over text

22) add variable for integrator strategy

26) go through code and update const-ness call to fucntions and methods

29) decrease dependencies across modules, IMPL or forward declaraions etc.

30) serialize integrator? or at least save all trajectories to file w/o binning

31) add number of cells/dim for binning to parameters and gui

AIRPLANE IDEAS:
integrator wrapper to store/save results
several methods: parallel OMP, parallel map/reduce, serial
need to look into saving/reading to/from disk as I go
create the whole interface for simulation class and start connecting it to pyqt/boosy python.
