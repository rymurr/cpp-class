1) figure out how to deal with potentials in 1&2 dimensions...extra functions??

2) finish constructor for potential

3) write/find a timer app similar to serguei's simple/easy/fun!

4) add a polarization parameter to fields

5) change around defaults eg: ndim = 4

6) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py

7) add id private member to fields class

8) expose more functions/options to python...full-ish API

9) Imortant to note that currently program assumes that tinitial is given at the peak of a real ionizatione event and initial conditions are sampled there only.

10) accept user input function for potential and field to generate. function handle in calling function for stuff I didnt think of.
