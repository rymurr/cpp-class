1) figure out how to deal with potentials in 1&2 dimensions...extra functions??

2) need to clean up interface and add icgen interface to python API

3) add a polarization parameter to fields, change field potential to only add fields at the right polarizations.

4) change around defaults eg: ndim = 4

5) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py. lots of documentation of GUI and backend...Doxygen AND Sphinx.

6) add id private member to fields class and make a static variable total fields. get rid of id initialization parameter

7) Imortant to note that currently program assumes that tinitial is given at the peak of a real ionizatione event and initial conditions are sampled there only.

8) need to start simplectic integrator and make a wrapper to GSL

9) need to design a/several parallelization types (map/reduce, MPI, OpenMP) for creation, running and binning of ICs

10) lots of gui connections to make to interface properly with code

11) design plotting schemes and write the interface

12) important to be able to transfer half done simulation from server to client and vice-versa

13) write SCP module for transfers - send, recieve, schedule, notify.

14) write binning methods, I like the boost library for 1D binners dunno about 2D though.

15) user docs in sphinx

16) distribute on more platforms! need a nicer icon...

17) make timer namespace

18) finish doxygen docs and add an intro section to Doxygen site, link to sphinx site
