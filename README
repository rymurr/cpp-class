1) figure out how to deal with potentials in 1&2 dimensions...extra functions??

2) need to clean up interface and add icgen interface to python API

3) add fields, coords and potentials to python API. make fields, coords, potentials tests. Make boost operators for all 3 also.

4) add a polarization parameter to fields

5) change around defaults eg: ndim = 4

6) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py. lots of documentation of GUI and backend...Doxygen AND Sphinx.

7) add id private member to fields class

9) Imortant to note that currently program assumes that tinitial is given at the peak of a real ionizatione event and initial conditions are sampled there only.

10) need to start simplectic integrator and make a wrapper to GSL

11) need to design a/several parallelization types (map/reduce, MPI, OpenMP) for creation, running and binning of ICs

12) lots of gui connections to make to interface properly with code

13) design plotting schemes and write the interface

14) important to be able to transfer half done simulation from server to client and vice-versa

15) write SCP module for transfers - send, recieve, schedule, notify.

16) write binning methods, I like the boost library for 1D binners dunno about 2D though.

17) user docs in sphinx

18) get some damn results!

19) distribute on more platforms! need a nicer icon...

20) get some damn results!

21) params_test is failing...why!

22) make iterators for coords class and probably template it to make it independent of double

23) make timer namespace

24) finish doxygen docs and add an intro section to Doxygen site, link to sphinx site
