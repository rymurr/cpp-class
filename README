1) figure out how to deal with potentials in 1&2 dimensions...extra functions??

5) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py. lots of documentation of GUI and backend...Doxygen AND Sphinx.

7) Imortant to note that currently program assumes that tinitial is given at the peak of a real ionizatione event and initial conditions are sampled there only.

8) need to start simplectic integrator and make a wrapper to GSL

9) need to design a/several parallelization types (map/reduce, MPI, OpenMP) for creation, running and binning of ICs

10) lots of gui connections to make to interface properly with code

11) design plotting schemes and write the interface

12) important to be able to transfer half done simulation from server to client and vice-versa

13) write SCP module for transfers - send, recieve, schedule, notify.

14) write binning methods, I like the boost library for 1D binners dunno about 2D though.

15) user docs in sphinx

16) distribute on more platforms! need a nicer icon...

18) finish doxygen docs and add an intro section to Doxygen site, link to sphinx site

21) add phi, polarization, to Python GUI. integrator strategy,  add descriptions to gui for mouse-over text

22) add variable for integrator strategy
