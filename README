1) figure out how to deal with potentials in 1&2 dimensions...extra functions??

1.5) finish constructor for potential

2) write/find a timer app similar to serguei's simple/easy/fun!

4) add a polarization parameter to fields

5) change around defaults eg: ndim = 4

6) docs! should be noted that ndim = 4 is x,px,y,py

7) add id private member to fields class
